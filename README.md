# TwitterMapper
## How to use:
Download tweets here: https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-user-tweets 
MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE @ IN THE FILE NAME (I don't error check lol)

Create a "Data" directory inside this repository, move all tweets into it

pip install matplotlib, openpyxl, networkx

run ```python excelparser.py```

You can now view your graph on index.html
